README
For best results, run this script on a fresh Ubuntu install.

Run this script as root:

$ chmod +x setupmailman.sh
$ sudo ./setupmailman.sh


This is almost completely unattended. You just have to do the following:
When postfix and mailman are done installing it will prompt for some settings.

In postfix 1st screen, press ok.
Now select "Internet Site".
Type localhost.localdomain in the text box prompted next.
For mailman, press ok.
Choose "en" as the language.

You don't need to do anything after that. If all worked fine. 
The mailman system should be up and running.
